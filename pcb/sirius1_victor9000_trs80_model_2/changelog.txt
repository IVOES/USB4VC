Added and hooked up connector for TRS-80 Model II

Although worlds apart in hardware architecture, the keyboard protocol of Sirius 1 and TRS-80 Model II is surprisingly similar.

Both uses keytronics foam and foil keyboard, which is why none of them works today.

Both uses serial communication, with DATA and CLK from KB to computer, and BUSY/ACK from computer to KB.

TRS-80 Model II can't seem to distinguish keydown and keyup events, it only sends data on keydown, and the data is the ASCII code.

Sirius 1 sends on both keyup and keydown, the MSB reflects that.
