	<h1> The IBM 1390876 Keyboard</h1>

	<p><strong>Note:</strong> You need a browser capable of displaying
	SVG images to see the keyboard layouts.</p>

<p>The IBM 1390876 is a 122-key keyboard, originally intended for use with an
IBM 3197 terminal. It is possible, with a little ingenuity, to connect it to 
and use it on a PC (under DOS and Linux, if not Windows).</p>

<p><img src="IBM%201390876%20keyboard_files/1390876.jpg" alt="" width="1005" height="349"></p>

<p>The keyboard has a 5-pin DIN plug that uses the 240-degree spacing. From
<a href="http://www.geocities.jp/kenjin_keyboard/1390876.htm">another site</a>,
I was able to get a pinout:</p>

<p>A normal AT keyboard uses the 180-degree spacing and this pinout:</p>

<embed src="IBM%201390876%20keyboard_files/modelf_pinout.svg" type="image/svg+xml" pluginspage="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/" width="522" height="522">

<p>It would, therefore, be possible to construct a simple adaptor. I was able
to use an alternative method: swap the keyboard lead with one from a real IBM
AT keyboard. Inside both types of keyboard, the lead connects to a 3x2 Berg 
connector with the same pinout, so I could simply swap the leads over.</p>

<h2>LEDs</h2>
<p>There are no LEDs, and no obvious connector for an LED panel. The 
keyboard controller accepts commands to set them, though.</p>

<h2>Identity</h2>
<p>When sent an identify command (0xF2), the keyboard returns the byte 
sequence 0xBF 0xBF. However, this can be changed. On the keyboard PCB is a
12-pin header, marked as 6 pairs of pins (B2-B7). These correspond to bits
5-0 of the second byte of the keyboard ID. Shorting a pair of pins sets that
bit to zero. So placing a jumper on the B2 pair will change the keyboard ID
to 0xBF 0x9F.</p>
<p>Adjacent to this header is a space on the circuit board for an identical
header, marked as pins A2-A7. Presumably these would have the same effect on
the first byte of the keyboard ID.</p>

<h2>Scancodes</h2>
<p>The keys on the 1390876 are laid out like this:</p>
<embed src="IBM%201390876%20keyboard_files/1390876_keytops.svg" type="image/svg+xml" pluginspage="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/" width="1005" height="300">

<p>When in use, the keyboard always uses <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-10.html">Scancode set 3</a>. It rejects requests to change the
scancode set. The scancodes it returns are:</p>
<embed src="IBM%201390876%20keyboard_files/1390876_raw.svg" type="image/svg+xml" pluginspage="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/" width="1005" height="300">
<p><strong>Notes:</strong>
</p><ul>
	<li>Only shaded keys send key-up sequences (F0 <var>xx</var>)</li>
	<li>Smaller numbers shown in circles are holes in the keyboard with 
	no springs, corresponding to unused positions covered by double-sized 
	keys.</li>
	<li>The unused position under the spacebar does not respond to being
	poked with a screwdriver, whereas the others do.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>These are then translated by the PC's keyboard controller to:</p>

<p>meaning that, on a PC, the keyboard behaves like an 84-key AT keyboard:</p>

<h2>Commands</h2>
<p>The keyboard accepts the following commands. Most of them behave as 
documented for the 
<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-12.html">102-key PS/2
	keyboard</a>, but there are a couple of 
<span style="color: #000; background-color: #FEE; ">exceptions</span>:</p>
<table border="1">
	<thead><tr><th>Command</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>ED <var>xx</var></td>
			<td>Set LEDs. Despite the keyboard not having any 
			  LEDs, it will accept this command and check that
			  the parameter is in the correct range (0-7).</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr><td>EE</td><td>Diagnostic echo.</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>F2</td><td>Read keyboard ID (usually BF BF).</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>F3 <var>xx</var></td><td>Set repeat rate and delay.</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>F4</td><td>Enable keyboard (clear errors).</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>F5</td><td>Disable keyboard.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>F6</td><td>Set defaults.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>F7</td><td>Set all keys to repeat. No keys will send
			break codes.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>F8</td><td>Set all keys to give make/break codes. No 
			keys will repeat.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>F9</td><td>Set all keys to give make codes only. No keys will 
			repeat or send break codes.</td></tr>
	<tr style="color: #000; background-color: #FEE; ">
		<td>FA</td><td>Behaves as FB. On a 102-key PS/2 keyboard, would
		set all keys to repeat and to give make/break codes.</td></tr> 
	<tr><td>FB</td><td>Set specified key(s) to repeat. They will not send
			break codes. Followed by a list of scancodes, which 
			should be terminated by F4.</td></tr>	
	<tr><td>FC</td><td>Set specified key(s) to give make/break codes. They
		       	will not repeat. Followed by a list of scancodes, which 
			should be terminated by F4.</td></tr>	
	<tr><td>FD</td><td>Set specified key(s) to give make codes only. They
			will not repeat or send break codes. Followed by a 
			list of scancodes, which should be terminated by 
			F4.</td></tr>	
	<tr><td>FE</td><td>Resend last scancode.</td></tr>
	<tr style="color: #000; background-color: #FEE; ">
		<td>FF</td><td>Reset. The keyboard will respond with AA (as
			for the 102-key keyboard) followed by the 2-byte
			keyboard ID.</td></tr>

	</tbody>

<p>The F0 command (set / get scancode set) is not supported.</p>

<h2>Under Linux</h2>
<p><img src="IBM%201390876%20keyboard_files/tarfile.png" alt="[TAR]" width="25" height="32" align="bottom"><a href="http://www.seasip.info/VintagePC/1390876.tar.gz">1390976.tar.gz</a> contains a script 
and keymap which, combined, make the keyboard rather more usable in the Linux 
console. Among other things, it makes the arrow keys work, moves the function
keys from the left to the top, and makes the symbols produced match the
keytops where possible.</p>

<h2>Under Windows 2000</h2>
<p>If the keyboard is connected directly to a Windows 2000 computer, it does
not work. Windows, during initialisation, resets the keyboard, and then gets
flummoxed by the extra bytes which result. It is possible to trick the 
keyboard into working by using a KVM switch: switch away from the computer 
when Windows starts to load, and switch back when Windows has loaded 
completely.</p>

<p><img src="IBM%201390876%20keyboard_files/regedt.png" alt="[REG]" width="47" height="39" align="bottom"><a href="http://www.seasip.info/VintagePC/1390876.reg">1390876.reg</a> remaps the cursor keys,
function keys, and various other keys so that they produce the scancodes that
Windows expects for their keycaps.</p> 

<p>If you have a copy of the Windows 2000 DDK, it's possible to build a 
patched version of the keyboard driver that doesn't try to do the reset. 
Apply this patch:</p>
<p><img src="IBM%201390876%20keyboard_files/text.png" alt="[DIFF]" width="25" height="32" align="bottom"> <a href="http://www.seasip.info/VintagePC/pnpi8042.diff">pnpi8042.diff</a></p>

<p>to the i8042 driver
(in <code>...\src\input\</code>), rebuild it, and replace 
<code>\winnt\system32\drivers\i8042prt.sys</code> with what you just built
(you may have to disable Windows File Protection or do the copy from an 
alternative OS. I'm told that booting in Safe Mode also allows you to make
the substitution).</p>

<p>When using the custom driver, the keyboard's hardware key repeat is 
disabled. If you turn on the FilterKeys functionality as described
<a href="http://discuss.pcmag.com/forums/thread/1004407379.aspx">here</a>, 
Windows will simulate key repeat in software.</p>

<p>Although this section describes Windows 2000, it probably applies to other
NT-based Windows systems such as Windows NT, XP and Vista. The supplied 
registry file requires Windows 2000 or later, and I haven't tested the patch
on later or earlier versions of the DDK.</p>

<h2>A Theory</h2>

<p>This is my guess at how the three scancode sets came to be:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Originally, there was only the IBM PC. This used Set 1.</li>
	
	<li>When the <a href="http://www.seasip.info/VintagePC/5271.html">3270 PC</a> was created in 1983, its 
	keyboard used Set 3. A plug-in ISA card was used to convert the 
	scancodes received to Set 1.</li>
	<li>When the PC AT was designed, it was decided to make its scancodes
	compatible with Set 3, so that you could connect either an 84-key 
	keyboard or a 122-key keyboard and not have to bother with the ISA 
	card. The keyboard controller would then translate back to Set 1
	for program compatibility.</li>
	<li>Then the 102-key extended keyboard entered the picture. It 
	couldn't use the corresponding codes from Set 3 for its extra keys, 
	because existing computers wouldn't be able to handle them. So Set 2
	was created for it, where the extra keys send E0 prefixes.</li>
	<li>But the option to switch to Set 3 was added, so that programs 
	which <em>did</em> support the 122-key keyboard wouldn't need to be
	changed. This also explains why the function keys are different in
	Sets 2 and 3; in Set 2, for backward compatibility, they return the 
	scancodes for the 'left' function key block, and in Set 3 they 
	return the scancodes for the 'top' function key block, which is where
	they now are.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just a theory, nothing more.</p>
